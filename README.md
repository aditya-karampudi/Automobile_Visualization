### Introduction

This is a Python based EDA project done out of an Automobile Dataset, where I have explored and analyzed three major factors of a car which are:
            
            Price
            Mileage 
            Performance 
            
I have also identified the ‘Best Car’ under the ‘Low Budget Car-Category’.

### Dataset Description

The Automobile Dataset consists of various information relating to the built, engine power, make, mileage and body attributes of a car.  The data types include integers, floating points, and strings.

The variables have been segregated as below.

### Price Analysis
From the graph it is clear that the price has varied mainly by three segments. Hence I have classified as low price segment, medium price segment and premium cars.

 Going in-depth we can find that the relation between the price and other attributes.
 As the engine sixe increases the price increases
 The mileage decreases price increases
 The horse power and price are directly co-related

 The boxplot of price and the drive distribution reveals that 4-wheel-drive vehicle are costliest followed by front-wheel drive and then rear wheel drive

 The price range based on body style shows that the hard-top and convertible are priceiest and are in same price range. Where as hatchback are cheapest of all
